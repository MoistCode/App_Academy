#  App_Academy/Alpha_Curriculum
###	This is a repository to keep track of App Academy Alpha Curriculum problems.Will refactor code as necessary for learning and for the sake of cleaning up the code. Alpha curriculum work will be in in the format of a #{firstname}_#{lastname} folder whereas projects from the bootcamp will be everything else.
